### Using a map with React

To make the map I used react-native-maps. To use this I installed it using "npm install -g react-native-maps".
The documentation used was from https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps.
From that I was able to assemble a basic map.
I set the intial map to show the city of Marakech, Morocco. For my color theme I used a google maps color style generator. I was able to choose my color theme and google would generate a json from it.

The following is a screenshot of the app in use on an android.
